# High Note Propensity Score Matching Project

## Introduction

High Note is an anonymized real music streaming company --- similar to Last.fm, Spotify or Pandora --- that uses a freemium business model. You are provided with High Note customer data, including:  

Demographic characteristics such as age, gender and country
Social network characteristics such as number of friends a user has on the network
Engagement level data on activities performed when using the service, which include the number of songs the user has listened to, playlists created, “shouts” sent to friends, etc.

## Project Objective

Given the higher profitability of premium subscribers, it is generally in the interest of company to motivate users to go from “free to fee”; that is, convert free accounts to premium subscribers. Your task in regards to this case is to analyze the data for potential insight to inform a “free-to-fee” strategy. 

Literature shows that peer influence and user engagement can affect users’ decisions to pay for a premium subscription. Using the High Note data, you can predict the decision to buy using both types of variables. Your results will quantify the effect of social engagement on revenue, as well as how valuable a premium subscriber can be in a freemium social community.
